## Description

This application is a timed quiz on JavaScrip fundamentals. It features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code and also uses Bootstrap.

The application has a countdown and gives the user 75 seconds to complete the quiz. If an answer is incorrect, 10 seconds are deducted from the time allotted for the quiz. If the timer reaches zero, or if there are no more questions, the quiz ends and prompts the user for their initials so that their score can be recorded on a highscore page.

Local storage is used to store the initials and score of the user so that they can retake the quiz and compare their progress, or have others take the quiz and be able to compare results.
